## Dough Making (Water-first method)

1. Pour all the water into the bowl and dissolve the yeast â€” using hands or a fork.

2. Add about 50% of the total flour and mix thoroughly until the texture resembles pancake batter.

3. Add the oil and salt to the bowl and incorporate carefully.

4. Add the remaining flour and knead into dough. If kneading by hand, this takes about 15â€“20 minutes â€” skip arm day today! ðŸ’ª

## First Rise (Bulk Fermentation)

Let the dough rest in a bowl or dough ball container for 60 minutes.

---

## Second Rise (Portioning & Cold Fermentation)

Divide the dough into individual balls and place them in the dough ball container. Let rest in the fridge for 12 hours.

After refrigeration, allow the dough to come to room temperature for 4 additional hours before use. While waiting, prepare the tomato sauce and toppings.

## Shaping the Dough (Rolling Method)

Place one dough ball on a lightly floured surface (use Semola flour) and press gently with fingertips to flatten.

Use a rolling pin to shape. Roman-style pizza is rolled to push out the air, making the dough flat and crispy.

## Baking

- In a pizza oven: Bake at 350Â°C for 3â€“5 minutes.
- In a home oven: Use the highest temperature setting with a pizza stone or baking steel.

**Rule of thumb:** Bake until golden brown and crispy.
