## 🧑‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Prepare the dough**  
   Knead flour, sugar, salt, butter (cut into pieces), and egg(s) into a smooth dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.

2. **Prepare the berries**  
   Wash the currants, let them drain, and strip them from the stems using a fork.

3. **Make the filling**  
   Melt butter in a saucepan. Add 100 g almonds and 100 g sugar, and roast until golden brown while stirring. Mix with the currants and cornstarch.

4. **Roll out the dough**  
   Roll out the dough between two layers of plastic wrap, place in a 26 cm (10-inch) springform pan, and form a high edge. Prick the base with a fork. Break wafers to fit and place on top of the dough.

5. **Prepare the meringue**  
   Beat egg whites with salt until stiff. Gradually add the remaining 100 g sugar until glossy. Fold in the remaining almonds and gently mix with the berry mixture.

6. **Bake**  
   Pour the filling onto the dough and smooth out. Bake in a preheated oven at **200 °C (392 °F)** for **50–60 minutes**. Optionally reduce to **180 °C (356 °F)** after 30 minutes.

7. **Cool & serve**  
   Dust with powdered sugar, let cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then remove and allow to cool completely.

## ✅ Notes
- If the dough is too crumbly, using a second egg can help.
- The tart tastes best fresh and slightly chilled.
